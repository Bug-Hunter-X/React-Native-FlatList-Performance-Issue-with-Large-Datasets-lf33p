This bug occurs when using the `FlatList` component in React Native with a large dataset.  The issue is that the component renders all items at once, causing performance issues and potentially crashing the app.  The `renderItem` function is called repeatedly for each item, leading to slow rendering and memory issues.  This is particularly noticeable on lower-end devices or when dealing with thousands of items.

```javascript
<FlatList
  data={largeDataset}
  renderItem={({ item }) => (
    <View>
      <Text>{item.text}</Text>
    </View>
  )}
/>
```
